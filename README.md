A collection of mostly application specific scripts made over the years for a Garry's Mod Server I maintained. 

This repo contains a dozen or so addon built for a DarkRP Server I maintained for a few years.

These scripts are heavilly aplication specific and have a lot of interplay between eachother so functionality on servers other than the one they are configured for is questionable.

Furthermore, functionality on Garry's Mod Versions other than the one the were originally built upon is also questionable.
